## Introduction
Hi, my name is David Rodriguez and I made this repository was made to monitor the various notes I will take related to Data Analysis, these notes include topics from Various Courses from Coursera, and Youtube, the technologies these courses talk about will vary and paint a picture of the various tools I know how to use and learned about. I created this repository so I could keep track of my notes through various devices and be able to have one place where everything can be done and kept, my main source of note taking is Obsidian because I like the UI and the various plugins I have access to, I like how it looks simple and not in your face like other note taking apps like Notion. Any online course I take from the Month of April in the year 2025 will be noted here, any achievements related to these courses and projects will also be kept here for ease of use and memory. Have a great time reading my notes and make sure to have some fun and contact me with any Buisness Oppertunities that you think come up if I meet your certain requirements or interest, have a good day!

## Courses
The courses included in this repository right now are, my main source of courses are either Youtube or Coursera, since NYC has the Coursera Program from the Department of Labour I thankfully have a source to learn from that is not a lot per year. Besides Coursera I use Youtube since the amount of free content is unlimited but there is a wide range of quality, my main source of tutorials is either FreeCodeCamp or even solo youtubers that post great content.

## Certifications
The certifications completed from April of 2025 to the point you are reading from will be listed below, anything not on here is probably not DA related or does not have any point of being here, if I got to special lecture series online I will most likely link them here if they are related to DA in some way.
